"""Tests for the reserved top-level URL prefix registry.

Covers:
  req-web-page-slug-sanitize.sec — Page slugs must not shadow real top-level routes
  req-tap-auth-app-4 — /auth is reserved

The registry (tap_web/reserved.py) collects each app's declared
`reserved_url_prefixes` plus project-level mounts. The key drift-prevention test
cross-checks the registry against the actual top-level URLconf, so a newly
mounted top-level route that forgets to declare itself fails here instead of
relying on reviewer memory.
