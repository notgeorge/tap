"""Tests for the on-by-default enforcement primitives (req-tap-auth-policy).

The backstop is stateless (req-tap-auth-policy-8): `assert_write_authorized` /
`assert_read_authorized` re-check what the *actor* holds via `policy.can`, with no
decision ledger. So these tests assert on the actor's capability profile — an
actor that holds the required capability passes; one that lacks it (or is absent)
fails closed with `UnguardedOperation`.
